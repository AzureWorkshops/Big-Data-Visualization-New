## Azure
We need an active Azure subscription in order to perform this workshop.  There are a few ways to accomplish this.  If you already have an active Azure subscription, you can skip the remainder of this page.  Otherwise, you'll either need to use an Azure Pass or create a trial account.  The instructions for both are below.

## Azure Pass
If you've been provided with a voucher, formally known as an Azure Pass, then you can use that to create a subscription.  In order to use the Azure Pass, direct your browser to [https://www.microsoftazurepass.com](https://www.microsoftazurepass.com) and, following the prompts, use the code provided to create your subscription.

## Trial Subscription
Direct your browser to [https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/free/](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/free/) and begin by clicking on the green button that reads **Start free**.

  1. In the first section, complete the form in its entirety. Make sure you use your _real_ email address for the important notifications.

  2. In the second section, enter a _real_ mobile phone number to receive a text verification number.  Click send message and re-type the received code.

  3. Enter a valid credit card number. **NOTE:** You will _not_ be charged.  This is for verification of identity only in order to comply with federal regulations.  Your account statement may see a temporary hold of $1.00 from Microsoft, but, again, this is for verification only and will "fall off" your account within 2-3 banking days.

  4. Agree to Microsoft's Terms and Conditions and click **Sign Up**.

This may take a minute or two, but you should see a welcome screen informing you that your subscription is ready.  The Azure subscription is good for up to $200 of resources for 30 days.  After 30 days, your subscription (and resources) will be suspended unless you convert your trial subscription to a paid one.  And, should you choose to do so, you can elect to use a different credit card than the one you just entered.

Congratulations!  You've now created an Azure tenant and subscription!
