In this workshop, you will complete a web app using Machine Learning to predict travel delays given flight delay data and weather conditions, plan the bulk data import operation, followed by preparation tasks, such as cleaning and manipulating the data for testing, and training your Machine Learning model.

By attending this workshop, you will be better able to build a complete Azure Machine Learning (ML) model for predicting if an upcoming flight will experience delays. In addition, you will learn to:
* Integrate the Azure ML web service in a Web App for both one at a time and batch predictions 
* Analyze batch data with SQL Data Warehouse
* Visualize batch predictions on a map using Power BI

This hands-on lab is designed to provide exposure to many of Microsoftâ€™s transformative line of business applications built using Microsoft big data and advanced analytics. The goal is to show an end-to-end solution, leveraging many of these technologies, but not necessarily doing work in every component possible. The lab architecture is below and includes:
* Azure Machine Learning (Azure ML)
* Azure Data Factory (ADF)
* Azure Storage
* HDInsight Spark
* Power BI Desktop
* Azure App Service


**Time Estimate:** 5.0 hours
